## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4287f5) to represent stability, trust, and technology, without being too corporate.
- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#F0F8FF) for a clean, unobtrusive backdrop that supports data visibility.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#A020F0) to draw attention to important actions or notifications, sitting to the 'left' of blue on the color wheel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for clarity and readability across all text elements; a modern and legible font choice
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings to give it a technological edge, but paired with PT Sans, only suitable for short bits of text.
- Use clean, line-based icons to represent various functions and statuses within the application.
- Implement a responsive, grid-based layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
